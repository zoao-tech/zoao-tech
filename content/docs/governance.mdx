This document outlines our vision for transitioning to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), the role of the ZoAO token within our ecosystem, and our preliminary tokenomics model.

---

## Overview

As the ZoAO ecosystem evolves, our long-term goal is to transition to a fully decentralized governance model that empowers community participation and drives innovation. The ZoAO token will be central to this visionâ€”serving as both the marketplace currency on [zoao.market](https://zoao.market) and the governance token for decision-making.

---

## DAO Transition Roadmap

- **Initial Phase:**  
  ZoAO.tech currently manages token standards, tooling, NFT campaigns, and other core components. In parallel, we are developing the frameworks needed to gradually transition governance to the community.

- **DAO Launch:**  
  Once key milestones are met, we will launch the DAO. This will allow token holders to propose and vote on critical decisions, ranging from protocol upgrades to marketplace policies.

- **Community Empowerment:**  
  Active participation will be incentivized, ensuring that decisions reflect the collective interests of our users, developers, and partners.

## Role of the ZoAO Token

The ZoAO token will be pivotal for the ecosystem, with multiple use cases:

- **Marketplace Currency:**  
  ZoAO tokens will be used for transactions on [zoao.market](https://zoao.market), powering the buying and selling of NFTs and other digital assets.

- **Governance:**  
  Token holders will have voting rights to shape the future of the platform, from technical upgrades to economic parameters.

- **Incentives & Rewards:**  
  Early adopters and contributors will be rewarded with tokens. For example, initial NFT holders from the [Zoo Keepers Genesis](/docs/zoo-keepers/overview) campaign will receive an airdrop, reinforcing engagement and ecosystem growth.

## Preliminary Tokenomics

While the tokenomics model will be refined over time, our initial outline includes:

- **Total Supply:**  
  A fixed or capped supply to ensure long-term scarcity and value.

- **Distribution Model:**  
  - **Airdrops:** NFT holders from the [Zoo Keepers Genesis](/docs/zoo-keepers/overview) campaign will be among the first to receive ZoAO tokens.
  - **Community Rewards:** Allocations for active participants, developers, and community initiatives.
  - **Ecosystem Fund:** A reserve for future development, strategic partnerships, and platform enhancements.

- **Usage Scenarios:**  
  - **Transaction Fees:** ZoAO tokens may be used to buy / mint or pay for fees on [zoao.market](https://zoao.market), with a portion of **fees potentially redistributed to token holders**.
  - **Staking & Incentives:** Future mechanisms may allow users to stake tokens for rewards or increased governance power.
  - **Exclusive Access:** Holding ZoAO tokens could unlock early access to new campaigns, premium features, or other ecosystem benefits.

## Next Steps

We are committed to transparency and community collaboration. Detailed tokenomics, including final supply figures, allocation percentages, and governance models, will be published as part of our ongoing development roadmap. Stay connected with our community channels for the latest updates and opportunities to participate in shaping the future of ZoAO.

This document provides a high-level view of our governance vision, the role of the ZoAO token, and our initial tokenomics framework. As we progress, we will continue to refine these details to ensure a robust, decentralized, and community-driven ecosystem.
