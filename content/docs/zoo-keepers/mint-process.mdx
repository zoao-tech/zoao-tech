This page provides a detailed walkthrough of the Zoo Keeper Genesis minting process. The process transforms an AO token payment into a fully minted and enriched ZooKeeper NFT through a secure, multi-stage pipeline. Each stage is designed to ensure uniqueness, security, and integration of AI-driven enhancements.

## **1. Minting Initiation**

In this initial stage, an external minter triggers the [ZooKeeper Mint Process](#) by sending AO tokens as payment. Once the payment is received, a new NFT is minted with "empty" metadata, indicating that it awaits further enrichment.

<Callout>Mint Process has access only to `Mint` Handler via Guarded Access Roles.</Callout>

```mermaid
graph LR;

U[User];

ZMP[ZooKeeper Minting Process];
ZP[ZooKeeper zNFT Process];

U --> |Sends AO Payment| ZMP;
ZMP --> |Mint| ZP;
ZP-->|Mint/Success|U;
```

### Explanation:
- User Payment: The process starts when a user sends AO tokens.
- Mint Request: The external minting system (operating under the minter role) processes the payment and issues a mint request.
- Pending NFT Creation: The ZooKeeper zNFT process creates a new NFT with “pending” metadata, signaling that further metadata generation is needed.

## **2. Off-Chain Oracle & LLM Trigger:**

After minting, an off-chain oracle monitors the blockchain for new NFTs in a pending state. Upon detecting a new NFT, the oracle triggers an LLM to generate detailed token traits and additional metadata.

<Callout>Off-Chain Oracle has access only to `Manage/Update-Metadata` Handler via Guarded Access Roles.</Callout>

```mermaid
graph LR;

ZP[ZooKeeper zNFT Process];
OO[Off-Chain Oracle];

subgraph OS [Off-Chain Services]
  LLM[Text LLM];
  ILLM[Image LLM];
  VLLM[Video LLM];
end

OO --> |Generate Metadata| LLM;
OO --> |Generate Image| ILLM;
OO --> |Generate Video| VLLM;
ZP o--o |Event/New-NFT| OO;
```

### Explanation:
- Oracle Monitoring: The off-chain oracle listens for events indicating new pending NFTs.
- LLM Integration: The text LLM is triggered to generate rich token traits and descriptions.
- Asset Generation: Parallel requests to image and video LLMs produce visual and video assets.

## **3. Genome Generation:**

The traits generated by the LLM are then processed by our custom [Genome Library](/docs/zoo-keepers/genome) (implemented in TypeScript). This module encodes the traits into a unique, compact genome string—a campaign-specific attribute that is later added to the NFT metadata.

```mermaid
graph LR;

OO[Off-Chain Oracle];
G[Genome Library];
LLM[Text LLM];

LLM --> |New zNFT Metadata| OO;
OO --> |zNFT Traits| G;
G --> |Encoded Genome| OO;
```

### Explanation:
- Trait Transmission: The oracle forwards the generated traits to the Genome Library.
- Encoding Process: The Genome Library encodes the traits into a genome string, ensuring each NFT has a unique genetic blueprint.
- Result Integration: The encoded genome is then sent back to be integrated into the NFT’s metadata.

## **4. Asset Creation & Metadata Finalization:**

In the final stage, AI systems generate visual and video assets based on the enriched metadata. These assets are then stored on fast-access platforms like Cloudflare and on permanent storage solutions such as Arweave.

Finally, the off-chain oracle updates the NFT’s metadata to include these assets and the newly generated genome, completing the minting process.

<Callout>Off-Chain Oracle has access only to `Manage/Update-Metadata` Handler via Guarded Access Roles.</Callout>

```mermaid
graph LR;

ZP[ZooKeeper zNFT Process];
OO[Off-Chain Oracle];
CF[Cloudflare];
AW[Arweave];

OO --> |Upload Fast-Access Assets| CF;
OO --> |Upload Permanent Storage Assets| AW;
OO --> |Manage/Update-Metadata| ZP;
```

### Explanation:
- Asset Generation: Visual and video assets are generated using AI technologies.
- Asset Storage: Assets are uploaded to Cloudflare for rapid access and to Arweave for permanent storage.
- Metadata Update: The off-chain oracle updates the NFT metadata with the asset links and the encoded genome, finalizing the minting process.

## Conclusion

The Zoo Keeper Genesis minting process is a robust pipeline that ensures each NFT is uniquely defined through AI-generated traits and a campaign-specific genome. By leveraging secure external minting, off-chain oracle monitoring, advanced LLM integrations, and efficient asset storage, our process lays a strong foundation for future evolution and interactive functionalities.
