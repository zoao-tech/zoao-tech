This document outlines the metadata schema used for Zoo Keeper Genesis zNFTs. The schema ensures that every token contains all necessary information in a consistent and extensible format, while also allowing for campaign-specific enhancements—most notably, the encoded genome.

## Metadata Schema Overview

Zoo Keeper Genesis zNFTs utilize a standardized metadata schema, which is designed to be both extensible and secure. The schema is defined in the [zNFT Token Standard](/docs/znft/metadata-structure) and is implemented in the znft-token-standard repository.

Each Zoo Keeper Genesis NFT metadata object includes the following fields:

import { TypeTable } from "fumadocs-ui/components/type-table";

<TypeTable
  type={{
    version: {
      description:
        "The metadata schema version. Constant value set to '0.1.0'.",
      type: "string",
      default: "0.1.0",
    },
    id: {
      description: "A unique identifier for the NFT metadata.",
      type: "string",
      default: "Token ID",
    },
    frozen: {
      description:
        "A string flag (`'true'` or `'false'`) indicating whether the metadata is locked from further changes. Defaults to `'false'` if not provided.",
      type: "string",
      default: "'false'",
    },
    name: {
      description: "A human-readable name of the NFT.",
      type: "string",
    },
    description: {
      description: "A detailed narrative about the NFT.",
      type: "string",
    },
    external_url: {
      description: "The external link associated with the NFT.",
      type: "string",
    },
    media: {
      description: "An array of media objects associated with the NFT.",
      type: "MediaObject[]",
      typeDescriptionLink:
        "/docs/znft/metadata-structure#mediaobject-interface",
    },
    attributes: {
      description: "An array of attribute objects representing NFT traits.",
      type: "Attribute[]",
      typeDescriptionLink: "/docs/znft/metadata-structure#attributes-interface",
    },
    properties: {
      description: "Extra properties defining NFT stats.",
      type: "Record<string, any>",
    },
    image_prompt: {
      description:
        "A string containing the prompt used to generate the NFT image.",
      type: "string",
    },
    video_prompt: {
      description:
        "A string containing the prompt used to generate the NFT video.",
      type: "string",
    },
  }}
/>

<Callout>
  Zoo Keeper Genesis zNFT will always contain the following attributes: `Genome`,
  `Species`, `Rarity`

## Metadata Validation

The metadata schema is validated using the [zNFT Token Standard](https://json-schema.org/). The schema validation module can be found in the znft-token-standard repository under `src/modules/metadata.lua` file.

Key validation steps include:

- **Type Enforcement**: Verifies that required fields are present and have the correct data types.
- **Media and Attributes**: Ensures that each media object and attribute conforms to the expected format.
- **Default Values**: Sets default values for optional fields such as isFrozen and alt text.
- **Properties**: Validates that all keys and values in the properties object are strings.

## Transitioning to Genome

While the metadata structure above forms the foundation for our NFTs, the Zoo Keeper Genesis campaign introduces an additional, campaign-specific element: **the genome**.

- **Genome Integration:**
  Unlike standard zNFT metadata, the genome is encoded as a unique attribute within the attributes array. It is not included by default, but is added during the campaign-specific minting process.

- **Purpose of the Genome:**
  The genome captures the NFT’s genetic blueprint—a compact, hexadecimal string generated by our custom Genome Library. It is derived from the detailed traits generated by our AI-driven systems and serves as the basis for future evolution and breeding mechanics.

In the next section, we will detail the genome encoding process, including:

- The structure and layout of the genome (e.g., version byte, species value, and trait-value pairs).
- The encoding steps that transform detailed traits into a genome string.
- How the genome is integrated into the NFT metadata as a campaign-specific trait.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the metadata structure for Zoo Keeper Genesis NFTs, ensuring consistency and extensibility across the collection. With this foundation in place, we can now delve into the innovative genome encoding process that distinguishes our campaign.
