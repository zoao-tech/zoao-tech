This document outlines the metadata schema used for Zoo Keeper Genesis zNFTs. The schema ensures that every token contains all necessary information in a consistent and extensible format, while also allowing for campaign-specific enhancements—most notably, the encoded genome.

---

## Metadata Schema Overview

Each Zoo Keeper Genesis NFT metadata object includes the following fields:

- **version**:  
  A string representing the schema version. This is useful for future upgrades and backward compatibility.

- **name**:  
  A human-readable token name.

- **description**:  
  A detailed description of the token, providing context and narrative.

- **media**:  
  An array of image objects for various resolutions or purposes. Each image object includes:

  - `id`: A unique identifier for the image.
  - `url`: A direct link to the image.
  - `mimeType`: The MIME type (e.g., `image/png`).
  - `alt`: Alternative text description for accessibility.

- **attributes**:  
  An array of attribute objects representing token traits. Each attribute includes:
  - `trait_type`: The name of the attribute (e.g., "Rarity", "Species").
  - `value`: The corresponding value of the attribute.

<Callout>
  Zoo Keeper Genesis zNFT will always contain the following traits: `Genome`,
  `Species`, `Rarity`
</Callout>

- **properties**:  
  An extensible object for any additional metadata. Both keys and values must be strings. These properties are used to store campaign-specific information.

- **isFrozen**:  
  A string flag (`"true"` or `"false"`) indicating whether the metadata is locked from further changes. Defaults to `"false"` if not provided.

Below is an example of a Zoo Keeper Genesis zNFT metadata:

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "name": "Token Name",
  "description": "A detailed description of the token.",
  "media": [
    {
      "id": "profile",
      "url": "https://example.com/image1.png",
      "mimeType": "image/png",
      "alt": "Primary view of the token"
    }
  ],
  "attributes": [
    {
        "trait_type": "Genome",
        "value": "A1B2C3D4E5F6G7H8I9J0"
    },
    {
        "trait_type": "Species",
        "value": "LION"
    }
    {
      "trait_type": "Rarity",
      "value": "Legendary"
    },
  ],
  "properties": {"power": "10","exp": "0"},
  "isFrozen": "false"
}
```

## Metadata Validation

The metadata schema is validated using the [zNFT Token Standard](https://json-schema.org/). The schema validation module can be found in the znft-token-standard repository under `src/modules/metadata.lua` file.

Key validation steps include:
- **Type Enforcement**: Verifies that required fields are present and have the correct data types.
- **Media and Attributes**: Ensures that each media object and attribute conforms to the expected format.
- **Default Values**: Sets default values for optional fields such as isFrozen and alt text.
- **Properties**: Validates that all keys and values in the properties object are strings.

## Transitioning to Genome

While the metadata structure above forms the foundation for our NFTs, the Zoo Keeper Genesis campaign introduces an additional, campaign-specific element: **the genome**.

- **Genome Integration:**
Unlike standard zNFT metadata, the genome is encoded as a unique attribute within the attributes array. It is not included by default, but is added during the campaign-specific minting process.

- **Purpose of the Genome:**
The genome captures the NFT’s genetic blueprint—a compact, hexadecimal string generated by our custom Genome Library. It is derived from the detailed traits generated by our AI-driven systems and serves as the basis for future evolution and breeding mechanics.

In the next section, we will detail the genome encoding process, including:
- The structure and layout of the genome (e.g., version byte, species value, and trait-value pairs).
- The encoding steps that transform detailed traits into a genome string.
- How the genome is integrated into the NFT metadata as a campaign-specific trait.
