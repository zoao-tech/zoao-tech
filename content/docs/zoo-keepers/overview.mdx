**Zoo Keepers Genesis** is our inaugural NFT campaign where AI-driven trait generation meets evolutionary innovation.

In this campaign, each NFT is minted via an external system under a dedicated **minter** role, triggering an off-chain process that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate detailed token traits. These traits are then encoded into a unique, campaign-specific genome using our custom Genome library—defining the individual identity of each character and laying the groundwork for future evolution and breeding mechanics.

## Campaign Concept

In Zoo Keepers Genesis, every NFT represents a unique character with its own genetic blueprint. The genome is not part of the standard zNFT metadata but is integrated as a campaign-specific trait. This process ensures that each token is truly one-of-a-kind and is designed to evolve over time.

## Key Features & Parameters

- **AI-Driven Trait Generation:**  
  An off-chain LLM generates detailed traits that provide each NFT with a unique personality and backstory.

- **Campaign-Specific Genome:**  
  Our custom Genome Library encodes the generated traits into a compact genome string, capturing the NFT's unique genetic blueprint.

- **Secure External Minting:**  
  Minting is handled externally by a backend system operating under a dedicated **minter** role, with robust role-based access controls and pausable mechanisms to ensure secure operations.

- **Royalty Mechanism:**  
  A global royalty fee of 5% is applied on secondary sales, supporting the ecosystem's ongoing development.

- **Future Evolution & Breeding:**  
  The encoded genome sets the stage for dynamic functionalities, including potential evolution and breeding mechanics, creating a living, interactive NFT ecosystem.

## **Cost & Supply**

- **Minting Cost:** Each NFT costs 1 $AO token to mint.
- **MaxSupply:** The total number of NFTs is capped at 969, ensuring exclusivity.
