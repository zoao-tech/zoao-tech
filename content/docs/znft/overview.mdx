## Features

The zNFT Token Standard is designed to support robust, secure, and extensible non-fungible tokens that meet the following objectives:

- **Supply Constraints (MaxSupply):** Enforces a hard cap on the total number of tokens that can be minted, ensuring scarcity and controlled issuance.
- **Pausable Mechanism:** Provides the ability to pause and unpause the contract, allowing for maintenance or emergency intervention while protecting token operations.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Uses a robust roles module to restrict sensitive operations to authorized accounts (e.g., minters and administrators).
- **Enhanced Metadata:** Supports extended metadata fields including name, description, metadata, and an `isFrozen` flag to denote if the metadata is immutable.
- **Metadata Freeze:** Offers a mechanism to permanently lock metadata, ensuring that once finalized, the tokenâ€™s information remains unchanged.
- **Global Royalty Mechanism:** Integrates a royalty module to enforce and manage global royalty settings, enabling automated distribution of royalty fees on secondary sales.
